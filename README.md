# [The Avocadoist](https://theavocadoist.com/)

This is a full stack application that I created for my wife to blog about anything.

This application has been built off of the following technologies.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the programming language.

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as the application framework.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for deployment.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database.

- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as a reverse proxy web server.

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for hosting.

- [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for image storage and hosting.
